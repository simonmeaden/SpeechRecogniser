A speech recogniser module using PocketSphinx.
==============================================

Intended as a speech recognition module written in Qt/C++ and intended to
be used by the Biblos project when I get that far. So far all it does is
read in data from a microphone and pass it on to an external plot in
the main test module.
PortAudio is used to actually read the data in as it is available for
many OS's.
